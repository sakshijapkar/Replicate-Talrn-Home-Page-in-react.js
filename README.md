# Replicate-Talrn-Home-Page-in-react.js
This is a faithful replication of the Talrn.com homepage built with React.js. The project uses Create React App to create a responsive, single-page application (SPA) that mirrors the original site's structure, content, and basic interactivity.It's designed as a frontend-only demo for educational or assessment purposes, focusing on component-based architecture, CSS Grid for layouts, and simple state management.
Key features replicated:

Header: Branding, tagline, and contact details.
Hero Section: Headline, subtext with stats, and CTA for job applications.
Features Section: Team augmentation info with an interactive industry dropdown (using useState).
Clients Section: Grid of 250+ client placeholders (e.g., Buyhive, Mogul) with engagement types.
Services Section: Managed services plans as pricing cards with CTAs.
Footer: News highlights, final CTA, and copyright.

The app is text-heavy and professional, with blue accents for CTAs. No backend integration (e.g., real images or API calls) to keep it lightweight.
Tech Stack

React.js (v18+ via Create React App)
CSS (Vanilla, with Flexbox and CSS Grid for responsiveness)
No external libraries (pure React for simplicity)
